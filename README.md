# EXPLORE-Al-Integrated-project-Transparency-in-tracking-Maji-Ndogo-s-water-funds
 Our mission is to communicate with transparency: Where did the money go? We will track the total budget against project completion, monitor teams' performance, and compare budgeted versus actual costs to flag potential corruption, promoting transparency and accountability in addressing Maji Ndogo’s water crisis.

• Current progress status of the project.
• Total expenditure to date.
• Breakdown of spending by location.
• Specifics on what the funds have been used for.
• Forecasting whether the allocated budget will suffice for project completion.
• Potential areas for cost reduction.
• Comprehensive data representation at national, provincial, and town levels
